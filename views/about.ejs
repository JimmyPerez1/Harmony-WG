      <p class="mb-4">
        I'm <strong>Jimmy Perez</strong>, a full stack developer, Army veteran, and former healthcare specialist turned tech builder. With a background spanning emergency medicine, health insurance, and software engineering, I’ve spent my career solving problems under pressure—and building systems that put people first.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-4">
        As an Army medic, I learned how to lead in high-stakes situations and developed the discipline and empathy that now shape my approach to technology. Later, in the health insurance world, I scaled a business across 30+ states by designing custom tools, automating workflows, and integrating AI to help people access the care they need.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-4">
        Today, I bring that same mindset to software development—focused on creating intuitive, responsive applications that make a real difference. Whether it’s improving mental health through data visualization, streamlining service workflows, or building social platforms that foster community, I lead every project with purpose, resilience, and integrity.
      </p>
